			<p>This game is a difficult multiplayer vertical platformer where you can goof off with friends, race to the top, and climb as high as you can to try to get that sweet victory prize at the very top. And if you have no internet, that's fine too, as you can play all by yourself passing and talking to NPCs. </p>
