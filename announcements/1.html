	<h1>Is this thing on?</h1>
	<p>Here is a rough outline of my plans for this whole schtick. The dates might change (the later they are the more likely they are going to be pushed back), but given a lot of these are years in the planning now the order of things will likely stay the same.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>90 Degrees ($4.99) - if motivation stays steady projected sometime late this summer</li>
		<li>PROTOTYPE.27 (free) demo - december of '24</li>
		<li>Super Boring Computer Job Simulator (free or $0.99) - sometime in '25 most likely</li>
		<li>PROTOTYPE.27 ($19.99) - '26 or '27</li>
		<li>Epic Adventure Of A Person To A Place That Is Very Far Away With A Magic Wizard Guy That Helps You On Your Journey ($19.99) - idk yet, after that</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Might sneak platformer toolbox full in there somewhere, not sure yet.</p>
	<p>All of this is predicted based on the facts that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I am the only active developer on all of these games (this may change, we will see)</li>
		<li>They will contain more polish than I usually put in any given game</li>
		<li>I'll be in college soon, and have a life to deal with</li>
	</ul>
	<p>90 Degrees may come out in chunks, I plan on splitting up level groups into 'acts' and getting experimental with level layout, design, and presentation. If that is the case, then the price for 90 Degrees will start lower and raise as more is added.</p>
	<p>PROTOTYPE.27 will be extremely experimental. Part of the point of <a href="/its-time-to-start-over">the 2024 april fools game</a> was not only to make a crazy lookin game, but also test stuff out. So in a sense, it was an actual demo. Because of this, it may take longer than expected.</p>
	<p>Super Boring Computer Job Simulator will require me to learn a 3D library or game engine. It should take less than a year to create once I know what I am doing, as it is not planned to be a very big game. That one will be a fun little break from the big games (though it is still just as important as the other two)</p>
	<p>As for Epic Adventure Of A Person To A Place That Is Very Far Away With A Magic Wizard Guy That Helps You On Your Journey, that one will take a while. It will also be a bit experimental, but unlike PROTOTYPE.27 less on the gameplay and aesthetics side of things and more experimental on storytelling. This should be the last piece of the puzzle required to solve everything, but I have ideas for more should I decide to do it.</p>
	<p>From there, I have no other plans. Not Alone may be worked on with PixlPerfect this coming summer at the same time I'm working on 90 Degrees (and who knows I might drag someone else into 90 Degrees as well), and a platformer toolbox rewrite may or may not be released. Over the summer however, I will be working on getting the web version back online.</p>
