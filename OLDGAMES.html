		<p>This game is a difficult multiplayer vertical platformer where you can goof off with friends, race to the top, and climb as high as you can to try to get that sweet victory prize at the very top. And if you have no internet, that's fine too, as you can play all by yourself passing and talking to NPCs. Complete with a level editor. <a target="_blank" href="https://insert-game-studios.itch.io/youre-not-alone">Game Jam Edition</a></p>

		<p>
			A chaotic and extremely difficult shooter game where your aim is controlled by the direction you move. The controls are simple: use WASD to move and Space to shoot. The farther you get, the more difficult it becomes. Good luck.

			The original version was made in under 6 hours, and I decided to remake it.
