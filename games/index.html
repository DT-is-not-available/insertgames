	<p>I have <a href="https://insert.games/announcements/1.html">a lot of things planned</a>, and this is where I will be putting said things.</p>

					<p><strong>UPDATE: For the first early beta (which is entirely FREE!) I have a release date set for June 1st.</strong></p>
					<p>90 Degrees is a game where you play as a red square jumping on grey platforms.</p>
					<p>This was my first ever game idea, and a rough proof of concept called <a href="https://insert.games/this-is-you">This is You</a> was released on June 6th, 2023. 90 Degrees is my attempt to fully realize the idea into a longer, steam-worthy game, that will contain many new levels, new game mechanics, a lot more polish, and a fully featured level editor.</p>
					<p>Just like This is You, 90 Degrees will not be an easy game to complete (actually, it will probably be much, MUCH harder to 100% than This is You)</p>
					<p>Expect a demo sometime soon! As soon as a Steam page is created for the game, I will link that here.</p>
					<p>A preview video of what you can expect from the early beta can be found below:</p>

	<h1>Free Web Games</h1>
	<p>A lot of this is old stuff I made while in high school. Some of it is bad, some of it is good, some of it is just ok. All of it is free.</p>
	<h2>Incomplete</h2>
	<p>These are games that aren't quite done. They could appear or disappear at any time, and I may not be actively working on them right now.</p>
